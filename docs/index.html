        This browser extension helps you focus on the job opportunities that you care about by hiding the ones you
        don't.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can specify which employers, job titles, and locations you want and to see and the extension will
        automatically remove the ones you don't.

        The Filter Editor is designed to appear alongside your LinkedIn job search results page and remain open while
        you navigate them.

        You can open and close the sidepanel at any time by clicking the extension's icon. To make this convenient,
        consider pinning the extension's icon to your browser's toolbar.

    <ul>

            The LinkedIn job search results page is visible on the left.

            The Filter Editor is visible in the sidepanel on the right.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the left, the two Amazon jobs in the "Top job picks for you"
            section are shown with a reddish background color because they
            were automatically dismissed by a job filter.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the right, the word "Amazon" appears under the Undesirable
            Employer heading. This is the filter that caused the two Amazon
            jobs to be automatically dismissed by this extension.

    <p>
        Here's a scenario that you've probably run into -- it's a scenario that this extension was designed specifically
        to address:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            LinkedIn shows you results that you're likely to dismiss, no matter how carefully you define your job search
            criteria.
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                You're scrolling or paging through the job search results.
                Some are relevant and interesting, and some are not. Some
                you're qualified for, and some you're not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Normally, you can click that little "x" (dismiss) button in the
                top-right corner of a search result to ask LinkedIn not to show
                you that job anymore.
            </p>
            <img src="./Linkedin-Dismiss-Button.png">
            <p>
                But the more you search, the more you run into these jobs you won't
                or can't apply to. Clicking the dismiss button becomes a chore.
                You start to notice patterns among the jobs you quickly dismiss:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    Certain employers don't offer any jobs that are interesting to you.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    They're contract agencies but you're looking for full-time work.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Certain job titles are not interesting to you.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    You're a software tester, but are seeing IT or software programmer jobs.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    There are locations that you're not willing to commute or relocate to.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Its easier to get LinkedIn to show you more jobs than to tell it what you don't want to see.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                So instead, this extension lets you describe what you're <em>not</em> looking for, and will
                <em>automatically</em> dismiss those job search results for you. Read on to learn how.
            </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Example scenario: Searching for "ski instructor" shows unrelated job titles</h4>

    <p>
        When I first searched LinkedIn for "ski instructor" positions, among the first 20 results, only one was a ski
        instructor and I had to scroll down quite a ways to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rest were related to physical activity and other
        sports, but not skiing. For example: Certified Personal Trainer, Swim Team Coach (Seasonal), and Group Fitness
        Instructor.

            <p>
                Search <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=4183456899&geoId=92000000&keywords=ski%20instructor">LinkedIn
                    Jobs for "ski instructor"</a>
            </p>
            <img src="./Scenario-Search-Ski-Instructor.png">
        </li>
        <li>
            Review the search results for "ski instructor" opportunities. If you're lucky, you'll find a job title that
            exactly matches "ski instructor", but chances are that many job titles are instead related to other sports,
            or use terms like "coach" and "trainer".
        </li>
        <li>
            Before you define filters that will remove jobs that don't belong, first create a filter that will protect
            the jobs you want to pay attention to:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In the Filter Editor (the sidepanel), look for the heading "Desirable Job Titles".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under that heading, click in the text box that contains "(type here)". The "(type here)" hint will
                    automatically disappear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Type "ski instructor" into that text box without the quotation marks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press the "✔️" button to add that "I like jobs with this title" filter.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now define one or more filters that will remove jobs that don't belong.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In the Filter Editor, look for the heading "Undesirable Job Titles".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under that heading, click in the text box that contains "(type here)". The "(type here)" hint will
                    automatically disappear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Into that text box, type <em>one</em> of the undesirable job titles. In my case, one of the
                    undesirable job titles was "Martial Arts Instructor".
                </li>
                <li>
                    🩷 Protip: It can be powerful to pair a longer, more specific phrase in a "Desirable" filter with a
                    shorter, less specific phrase in the corresponding "Undesirable" filter. For example:
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Desirable Job Title: "ski instructor"</dt>
                        <dd>This will prevent the phrase "ski instructor" from being dismissed when it appears in a job
                            title.</dd>
                        <dt>Undesirable Job Title: "instructor"</dt>
                        <dd>When a job title contains the word "instructor" but <em>not</em> the phrase "ski
                            instructor", it will be dismissed. This includes "golf instructor" and "yoga instructor", so
                            you don't have to specify each undesirable instructor separately!</dd>
                    </dl>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Press the "✔️" button to add that "I don't like jobs with this title" filter.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Shortly after pressing the "✔️" button, you'll see the page automatically update.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each job that has a title of "instructor" but not "ski instructor" will be dismissed for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each dismissed job will be shaded pink.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note that job titles without "instructor", such as "lacrosse coach", are not affected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    And of course the one "ski instructor" position was preserved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ℹ️ Note that new text appears underneath each job that was touched by a filter. If a title matches
                    an undesirable filter, the new text will say "Title matches undesirable pattern '<em>pattern</em>'."
                    and be shaded orange or reddish. If a title matches a desirable title filter, the new text will say
                    "Title matches desirable pattern '<em>pattern</em>'." and be shaded green.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ⚠️ Note the word <em>pattern</em>: each filter is actually treated as a <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity">case-insensitive</a> <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>, so please be
                    careful to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence">escape</a> punctuation marks.

    <h2><a name="howItWorks">How the Extension Works</a></h2>

    <p>
        Each LinkedIn job search result generally looks like this:
    <table style="margin: 0 5em 0 5em; border: 1px solid black">
        <tr valign="top">
            <td width="20%"">icon</td>
                <td width=" 70%" colspan="5">

                <br />company name
                <br />job location
                <br />pay rate

            </td>
            <td width="10%" style="text-align: center">x</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        This extension pays attention to the job title, company name, and job location.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each job on the page:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The extension checks the job title against every <em>undesirable</em> job title filter, looking for a match
            as a case-insensitive regular expression. If any match is found, it takes note.
        </li>
        <li>
            The extension then checks the job title against every <em>desirable</em> job title filter, looking for a
            match as a case-insensitive regular expression. If any match is found, it takes note.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is repeated with the employer name filters and the job location filters.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                ⚠️ If any undesirable filter matches, but none of the <em>corresponding</em> desirable filters match,
                the job is dismissed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, a desirable <em>employer name</em> match cannot cancel an undesirable <em>job title</em>
                match. Only a desirable <em>job title</em> match can prevent an undesirable <em>job title</em>
                match from causing a job to be dismissed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            As you interact with the search results, for example by <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_scrolling">scrolling</a>), LinkedIn can update the contents
            of the page without refreshing it.  To keep up, this extension will continuously scan the page for changes and apply your filters again to every visible job search result.  As a result, especially on infinitely scrolling search results, you might see waves and waves of jobs being automatically dismissed and making room for new ones to scroll into view.
        </li>
